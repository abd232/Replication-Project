# Air PnP Replication Project

Static HTML/CSS/JS replica of an Airbnb-style landing page built by three
contributors (header, main content, footer) and merged into a single page.

## Features
- Fixed header with collapsing search bar
- Scrollable card carousels
- Footer tabs + privacy underline interaction
- Simple dark/light theme toggle

## Project Structure
- `index.html` page markup
- `style.css` styles for header, main, and footer
- `script.js` interactions (header collapse, carousel scroll, footer tabs, theme)
- `Images/` header assets
- `assets/` main section images
- `images- airbnb/` footer icons

## Run Locally
No build step is needed.
1) Open `index.html` in your browser.
2) Scroll to see the header collapse and carousels.
3) Click `Dark` to toggle theme.

## Notes
- If images do not load, confirm the folders `Images/`, `assets/`, and
  `images- airbnb/` exist at the project root.
